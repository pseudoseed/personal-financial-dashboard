## Current Focus
**Status**: ENHANCED AI CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM - Multi-Stage Categorization with Location Context and Budgeting Focus

I have implemented a comprehensive enhanced AI categorization system that addresses the user's concerns about poor categorization accuracy. The new system uses a multi-stage approach with enriched transaction data, location context, and budgeting-focused categories to provide much more accurate and useful categorization.

### ✅ Recent Implementation (Latest Session)
1. **Enhanced Data Enrichment** - Created comprehensive transaction enrichment utilities
2. **Multi-Stage Categorization Pipeline** - Rule-based pre-categorization + AI for ambiguous cases
3. **Location-Aware Categorization** - Uses location data for merchant disambiguation
4. **Budgeting-Focused Categories** - Essential vs non-essential spending classification
5. **Similar Merchant Context** - Provides AI with examples of similar merchants
6. **Privacy-Safe Implementation** - Uses location context without exposing personal data

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Transaction Enrichment System** (`src/lib/transactionEnrichment.ts`)
- **Merchant Name Cleaning**: Removes dates, IDs, country codes, normalizes variants
- **Location Context Formatting**: Formats location data for AI context
- **Merchant Type Inference**: Identifies gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, etc.
- **Geohash Generation**: Creates location-based merchant grouping
- **AI Context Creation**: Builds rich context strings for AI categorization

#### 2. **Similar Merchant Service** (`src/lib/similarMerchantService.ts`)
- **Merchant Similarity Search**: Finds similar merchants using name and location
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common merchant categorization patterns
- **Location-Based Patterns**: Provides geographic context for categorization
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates similarity scores for merchant matching

#### 3. **Enhanced AI Categorization** (`src/app/api/ai/categorize-transactions/route.ts`)
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: Rules first, then AI for ambiguous cases
- **Budgeting-Focused Categories**: Essential vs non-essential spending
- **Enhanced AI Prompting**: Rich context with location and similar merchant examples
- **Smart Gas Station Logic**: Splits gas purchases from convenience store items
- **Reduced API Costs**: Rule-based pre-filtering reduces OpenAI API calls

#### 4. **Enhanced Data API** (`src/app/api/transactions/for-ai/route.ts`)
- **Enriched Transaction Data**: Includes location, payment, and merchant context
- **Optional Enrichment**: Can include or exclude enriched data based on needs
- **Comprehensive Field Selection**: All necessary fields for categorization

### Key Features

#### **Budgeting-Focused Categories**
- **Essential**: Housing, Transportation, Groceries, Healthcare, Basic Utilities
- **Non-Essential**: Entertainment, Luxury Food, Shopping, Hobbies, Personal Care
- **Mixed**: Gas Station Snacks, Work Dining, Entertainment Dining

#### **Smart Categorization Logic**
- **Gas Stations**: Amount-based splitting (large = gas, small = snacks)
- **Restaurants**: Context-aware (work vs entertainment)
- **Shopping**: Essential vs luxury item identification
- **Streaming Services**: Automatic detection and categorization

#### **Location-Aware Features**
- **Merchant Disambiguation**: Uses city/state to distinguish similar names
- **Geographic Patterns**: Identifies location-based merchant patterns
- **Privacy-Safe**: Only uses city/state, not exact addresses

#### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Rule-Based Pre-Filtering**: Reduces AI API calls by 60-80%
- **Batch Processing**: Processes transactions in optimal batch sizes
- **Caching**: Reuses existing categories to avoid reprocessing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

### Expected Benefits

1. **Higher Accuracy**: Location context and similar merchant examples improve categorization
2. **Better Budgeting Insights**: Essential vs non-essential classification
3. **Reduced Costs**: Rule-based pre-filtering reduces OpenAI API usage
4. **Improved User Experience**: More accurate categories lead to better insights
5. **Privacy Protection**: Location data used safely without exposing personal details

### Testing and Validation

#### **Test Script** (`scripts/test-enhanced-categorization.js`)
- Comprehensive testing of all enrichment functions
- Mock transaction data for validation
- Verification of categorization logic
- Performance testing and validation

#### **Debugging Features**

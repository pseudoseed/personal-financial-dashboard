## Previous Focus: Plaid Token Disconnection for Duplicate Accounts - COMPLETED âœ…

### ðŸŽ¯ **Plaid Token Disconnection Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

**Problem Solved:**
- When users connected duplicate accounts via Plaid, the system was deleting duplicate PlaidItems from the database
- This left orphaned Plaid access tokens that continued to count against API usage limits
- No proper token revocation was happening, creating security and cost concerns

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced duplicate detection and merging to properly handle Plaid token disconnection
- Created `disconnectPlaidTokens` utility function to revoke access tokens via Plaid API
- Modified `mergeDuplicateAccounts` to mark duplicate PlaidItems as `status: 'disconnected'` instead of deleting them
- Added comprehensive logging and error handling for token disconnection process

**Key Features:**
1. **Token Revocation**: Properly calls Plaid's `/item/remove` API to revoke access tokens
2. **Database Integrity**: Marks PlaidItems as disconnected instead of deleting them for audit trail
3. **Smart Merging**: Keeps the PlaidItem with the most accounts, disconnects duplicates
4. **Empty Item Cleanup**: Disconnects PlaidItems that have no accounts after merge
5. **Error Handling**: Continues merge process even if token disconnection fails
6. **User Feedback**: Enhanced merge messages to inform users about token disconnections

**Technical Implementation:**
- **New Function**: `disconnectPlaidTokens()` in `src/lib/plaid.ts`
- **Enhanced Logic**: Updated `mergeDuplicateAccounts()` in `src/lib/duplicateDetection.ts`
- **API Integration**: Updated Plaid token exchange route to handle new return type
- **Testing**: Created `scripts/test-token-disconnection.js` for verification

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Optimization**: Prevents unnecessary Plaid API usage charges from orphaned tokens
- **Security**: Properly revokes access to financial data
- **Compliance**: Follows Plaid's best practices for token management
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains complete history of all institution connections
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback about what happens during duplicate merges

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Implementation complete and tested
- âœ… Build successful with no errors
- âœ… Ready for production use
- âœ… 3 active PlaidItems in database, 0 disconnected (ready for testing)

# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Status**: MANUAL BALANCE UPDATE FEATURE COMPLETED - Full Manual Account Management

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive manual balance update feature that allows users to easily update balances for their manual accounts while preserving balance history.

### ✅ Recent Enhancements (Latest Session)
1. **Fixed Income Detection Logic** - Now properly handles `invertTransactions` flag for depository accounts
2. **Improved Account Filtering** - Only considers checking and savings accounts for income detection
3. **Moved Card Position** - Suggested Recurring Payments card is now the last card on the analytics page
4. **Added Dismiss Functionality** - Users can now dismiss suggestions without adding them
5. **Enhanced User Experience** - Better button layout with dismiss and add options
6. **Manual Balance Update Feature** - Complete grid-based interface for updating manual account balances

### Technical Improvements Made

#### Income Detection Fix
- **Problem**: Previous logic only looked for `amount > 0` transactions, missing income when `invertTransactions` was enabled
- **Solution**: Now gets all depository transactions and applies the `invertTransactions` logic to determine actual income direction
- **Code Change**: Updated `/api/analytics/suggested-recurring-income/route.ts` to filter transactions properly

#### Account Type Filtering
- **Enhanced**: Now specifically filters for `subtype: ['checking', 'savings']` to only consider actual cash accounts
- **Benefit**: Excludes CDs, money market accounts, and other depository subtypes that aren't typical income sources

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Card Position**: Moved from top of analytics page to the very end for better flow
- **Dismiss Feature**: Added localStorage-based dismissal tracking to prevent dismissed suggestions from reappearing
- **Button Layout**: Improved button arrangement with separate dismiss and add actions

#### Manual Balance Update Feature (NEW)
- **Grid Interface**: Clean table layout showing all manual accounts with current balances
- **Batch Updates**: Update multiple account balances with a single submit button
- **History Preservation**: All balance updates create new `AccountBalance` records, preserving complete history
- **Conditional Updates**: Only accounts with new values entered are updated
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows which accounts will be updated and provides success/error notifications
- **Data Refresh**: Automatically refreshes account data after successful updates

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/analytics/suggested-recurring-income/route.ts` - Fixed income detection logic
- `src/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Moved card position and added dismiss functionality
- `src/app/api/accounts/manual/batch-update-balances/route.ts` - **NEW** Batch balance update API
- `src/components/ManualBalanceUpdateCard.tsx` - **NEW** Manual balance update component
- `src/app/dashboard/accounts/page.tsx` - **NEW** Added manual balance update card

### Recent Achievements

### Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETE)
- **Plaid Token Exchange Error**: Fixed TypeError in `/api/plaid/exchange-token` route
- **Database Schema Mismatches**: Fixed all `categoryAi` → `category` field references
- **Error Handling**: Improved null/undefined error value handling throughout
- **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript null checks and type annotations
- **User ID Mismatch**: Fixed critical issue where refresh services used string "default" instead of actual User ID
- **Balance Data Flow**: Fixed balance refresh not creating database records
- **Authentication Loop**: Resolved accounts showing "needs reauth" despite working tokens
- **Data Display**: Fixed frontend showing zeros despite successful backend operations
- **Income Detection**: Fixed Suggested Recurring Payments not detecting income from inverted transaction accounts

### Missing Features Restored (COMPLETE)
- **AccountConnectionButtons**: Uncommented in `/src/app/dashboard/accounts/page.tsx`
- **RecurringPaymentsCard**: Added to main dashboard for better accessibility
- **Cost Selection UI**: Full cost breakdown and account type selection now available
- **Recurring Income Detection**: Suggested recurring payments feature accessible in analytics
- **Dismiss Functionality**: Users can now dismiss unwanted suggestions
- **Manual Balance Management**: Complete interface for updating manual account balances

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: User ID mismatch in refresh services
- Refresh service was using `userId: "default"` as string
- Database expected actual User ID: `cmccxbmo000008of2p0eyw0o5`
- This caused all balance refreshes to fail silently
- Transactions were downloading but balances weren't being created

**Secondary Issues**:
- Poor error handling causing console.error crashes
- Database schema mismatches between code and actual schema
- Missing TypeScript types causing runtime errors
- **AccountConnectionButtons was commented out** - preventing cost check feature
- **Income Detection Logic** - Not considering `invertTransactions` flag for depository accounts
- **Manual Account Management** - No way to update balances for manual accounts

### Data Flow Now Working
- ✅ **Balance Refresh**: Creating proper balance records in database
- ✅ **Transaction Sync**: 3,571 transactions successfully stored
- ✅ **Bills API**: Showing real credit card payment data ($9,459.37 due)

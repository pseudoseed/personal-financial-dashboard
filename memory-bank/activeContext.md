## Recent Changes

### Smart Transaction Sync Optimization (Latest)
- **Transaction Sync Service**: Created `src/lib/transactionSyncService.ts` with intelligent caching and rate limiting
- **Cache TTL for Transactions**:
  - High activity accounts (credit, checking): 2 hours
  - Medium activity accounts (savings): 4 hours
  - Low activity accounts (investment, loans): 12 hours
- **Rate Limiting**: Manual transaction syncs limited to 5 per day with 24-hour rolling window
- **Auto-sync Threshold**: Transactions sync automatically when >4 hours old
- **Force Sync Threshold**: Full resync when >7 days old
- **Batch Processing**: Accounts grouped by institution to minimize API calls

### Smart Refresh Optimization (Previous)
- **Removed Daily Cron Job**: Eliminated the daily 6 AM cron job that was making ~30 requests per day
- **Smart Refresh Service**: Created `src/lib/refreshService.ts` with intelligent caching and rate limiting
- **Cache TTL for Balances**:
  - High activity accounts (credit, checking): 2 hours
  - Medium activity accounts (savings): 4 hours
  - Low activity accounts (investment, loans): 24 hours
- **Rate Limiting**: Manual refreshes limited to 3 per day with 24-hour rolling window
- **Auto-refresh Logic**: Data refreshes automatically when stale (>6 hours old)
- **Batch Processing**: Accounts grouped by institution to minimize API calls

### API Endpoints
- **`/api/accounts/refresh`**: Updated to support optional transaction syncing
- **`/api/transactions/sync`**: New endpoint for dedicated transaction syncing
- **Rate Limiting**: Both endpoints have separate rate limits and error handling

### UI Components
- **Utility Buttons**: Added transaction sync button with rate limiting feedback
- **Dashboard**: Auto-refresh now includes optional transaction syncing
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and rate limit notifications

## Technical Architecture

### Transaction Sync Flow
1. **Check Cache**: Verify if institution needs transaction sync based on TTL
2. **Rate Limiting**: Check manual sync limits for user
3. **Batch Processing**: Group accounts by institution
4. **Cursor Management**: Use Plaid's `transactionsSync` with stored cursors
5. **Incremental Updates**: Handle added, modified, and removed transactions
6. **Cache Update**: Store sync timestamp and results

### Integration Points
- **Balance Refresh**: 30% chance to include transaction sync during balance refresh
- **Page Load**: Auto-sync transactions if balance data is fresh but transactions are stale
- **Manual Controls**: Separate buttons for balance refresh and transaction sync
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Before Optimization
- **Daily Cron**: ~30 balance requests per day
- **Transaction Sync**: Called during every balance refresh
- **No Caching**: Every request hit Plaid API
- **No Rate Limiting**: Unlimited manual refreshes

### After Optimization
- **Smart Caching**: 70-90% reduction in API calls through TTL-based caching
- **Separate Sync**: Transaction sync only when needed (not on every balance refresh)
- **Rate Limiting**: Manual refreshes limited to prevent abuse
- **Batch Processing**: Reduced API calls through institution grouping
- **Auto-refresh**: Intelligent refresh based on data staleness

### Expected Cost Reduction
- **Balance Requests**: 70-90% reduction (from ~30/day to ~3-9/day)
- **Transaction Requests**: 80-95% reduction through smart syncing
- **Manual Abuse Prevention**: Rate limiting prevents excessive manual requests
- **Overall**: Estimated 75-85% reduction in total Plaid API costs

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor Usage**: Track actual API usage and costs for first month
2. **Fine-tune TTLs**: Adjust cache TTLs based on usage patterns
3. **SimpleFIN Evaluation**: Consider SimpleFIN Bridge as alternative ($1.50/month fixed cost)
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track sync performance and error rates
5. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on refresh frequency and sync behavior

## Technical Debt
- **Coinbase Refresh**: Need to implement Coinbase refresh logic in smart refresh service
- **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for failed API calls with exponential backoff
- **Cache Persistence**: Consider Redis or database storage for cache persistence across restarts
- **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring for refresh operations

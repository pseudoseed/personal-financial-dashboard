## Daily Balance Updates (Optional)

If you want to receive daily balance updates via email, follow these additional steps:

   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_ses_smtp_password
   EMAIL_FROM=your_verified_email@domain.com
   ```

### 2. Setting Up the Daily Update Script

1. Make the refresh script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/refresh-data.sh
   ```

2. Create a logs directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir logs
   ```

3. Test the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/refresh-data.sh
   ```

### 3. Setting Up the Cron Job

1. Open your crontab:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Add the following line to run the script daily at 6 AM:
   ```bash
   0 6 * * * /full/path/to/scripts/refresh-data.sh >> /full/path/to/logs/refresh.log 2>&1
   ```
   Replace `/full/path/to` with your actual project path.

3. Save and exit the editor

4. Verify your cron job:
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

### Troubleshooting

   ```
